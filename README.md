# Microsoft Sentinel

Warning: Not an expert!

All I do is grab the KQL queries that I find interesting and work with and keep it in one place for ease of reference.
Some are shamelessly stolen from Microsoft's <a href = https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries> Azure Sentinel GitHub Repository </a>. Some of them were hand crafted by myself.

Feel free to use them. :)
